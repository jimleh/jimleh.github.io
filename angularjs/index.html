            Here are some of the things I've done with AngularJS.
        </p>

                A Quiz I originally made as part of an MVC/AngularJS <a href="https://github.com/Epoxie/MiniProject">project</a> together with <a href="https://github.com/Epoxie">Epoxie</a>.
                <br/>
                As the name suggests it's a quiz game where you're supposed to build sentences, but I thought it would be a bit more interesting to use tongue twisters instead of "normal" sentences.
                <br/>
                I guess the code could use some "cleaning", but it'll stay on my to-do list for the time being.
            </li>
