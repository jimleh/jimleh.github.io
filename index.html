            Here are some of the types of projects I've been having fun with.
            <br/>
            Some of the projects are things I've been doing during my free time and some are from different kinds of courses. Most web projects are using Bootstrap 3.3.7 but I'm planning to get started with Bootstrap 4 eventually.

            Here's a <a href="https://github.com/jimleh">link</a> to my full repository, mainly for the lazy ones.

                    A couple of simple AngularJS projects that I'm particularly fond of.

                    Link to a different site with my assignments from a course in web development (PHP/MySQL/JS) at Lule&aring; University of Technology during the spring of 2018.
                    The last assignment used a database that was provided by the university, so I'm not entirely sure how long it will stay online.
