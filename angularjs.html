            Here are some of the things I've done with AngularJS. Eventually I will start adding Angular 2+ projects as well.

                    <a href="angularjs/sentence.html">SentenceBuilder</a> - 
                    A Quiz I originally made as part of an MVC/AngularJS <a href="https://github.com/Epoxie/MiniProject">project</a> together with <a href="https://github.com/Epoxie">Epoxie</a>.
                    <br/>
                    As the name suggests it's a quiz game where you're supposed to build sentences, but I thought it would be a bit more interesting to use tongue twisters instead of "normal" sentences.
                    I guess the code could use some "cleaning", but it'll stay on my to-do list for the time being.
                </p>

            <li>
                    <a href="angularjs/punctuation.html">PunctutaionExercise</a> - 
                    Another Quiz I originally made as part of the same <a href="https://github.com/Epoxie/MiniProject">project</a> together with <a href="https://github.com/Epoxie">Epoxie</a>.
                    <br/>
                    As the name suggests it's a quiz game where you're place punctuation marks at the correct places in a sentence, and this one also uses tongue twisters instead of "normal" sentences.
                    Like the SentenceBuilder the code for this one could also use some "cleaning", but it'll also stay on my to-do list for the time being.
